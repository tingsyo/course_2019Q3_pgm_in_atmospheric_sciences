# [course] Applying Graph-based Algorithms to Atmospheric Sciences

This is the course materials for independent research opened in NTU-AS.

This module will cover some introductions to the basic *graph theory*, *probabilistic graphical models*, and *spectral graph theory*, as well as some graph-based (or network-based) algorithms such as *spectral clustering*. 

Some examples of applying such algorithms to meteorological dataset will also be covered.
